# Decision Log

These decisions need to be rolled into the AGENTS.md

## 1. wrangler.local.jsonc vs. wrangler.jsonc.tpl

There were problems with running vite with an alternate wrangler.jsonc, so the decision was made that wrangler.local.jsonc would be abandoned.  The approved way is to use a scripts/generate-local-wrangler.js and use that to generate a local version of wrangler.jsonc.  

Since local dev needs a separate environment, the .dev.vars overrides ENVIRONMENT (check this in if there are no secrets in it).  Also, package.json scripts was extensively modified for this new situation and to create the proper workflow.

## 2. vitest projects

We use vitest projects to organize tests.  Don't use playwright.  There is a vitest.config.ts for each type of test - integration in tests/integration, worker in src/worker and client in src/client.  Unit tests sit alongside the source file under test.  Integration tests for the API are separate.

We also added coverage with istanbul to the setup

## 3. Deployment of the worker

Since you can't connect the worker to a domain name until you have a worker deployment, we decided to allow an initial deployment of the worker which will then be overwritten by the wrangler deploy version.

## 4. Source organization

We organize source files for testability.  Do NOT put everything in one file.

## 5. Logging

Just use cloudflareLogger() - don't try to be fancy with log levels or anything like that.
