# Agentic Chat

An authenticated enterprise AI chat agent based on Cloudflare Workers, D1, Cloudflare Access, Durable Objects, the Agents SDK, Workers AI, AI Gateway, and Dynamic Workers.

> This demo ships in phases (see `docs/06-AGENTIC-CHAT.md`), each tagged in git so any two can be diffed. This checkout currently implements **Phase 1 (Scaffolding)** only: a working, Access-gated, empty shell with a D1 user directory. Later phases add the chat agent itself, model routing, cost tracking, tools, skills, and an admin console.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 or newer and npm 11 or newer.
- Terraform 1.10 or newer.
- A Cloudflare account with a zone that can host `<DEMO_NAME>.<DEMO_DOMAIN>` (default `agentic-chat.cfapps.uk`) and no conflicting CNAME on that hostname.
- A Cloudflare Zero Trust team with at least one enabled identity provider — any authenticated user from that provider can sign in.
- A Cloudflare API token scoped to the target account and zone with:
  - Entire Account > Developer Platform > Workers Scripts: Edit
  - Entire Account > Developer Platform > D1: Edit
  - Entire Account > Developer Platform > Workers AI: Edit (local development only — see Troubleshooting)
  - Entire Account > Developer Platform > AI Gateway: Edit
  - Entire Account > Cloudflare One / Zero Trust > Access: Edit
  - Entire Account > Cloudflare One / Zero Trust > Access: Identity Providers: Read
  - `<your-domain>` > DNS & Zones > DNS: Write

## Environment Configuration

```sh
cd demos/agentic-ai-chat
cp .env.example .env
```

Set every value in `.env`:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | API token with the permissions listed above. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Account that owns the Worker, D1 database, AI Gateway, and Access application. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` | Zone ID for `DEMO_DOMAIN`. |
| `DEMO_DOMAIN` | Zone hostname the demo is deployed under, e.g. `cfapps.uk`. |
| `DEMO_NAME` | Worker name, AI Gateway id, and hostname label, e.g. `agentic-chat` for `agentic-chat.cfapps.uk`. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN` | Access team domain without `https://`, e.g. `example.cloudflareaccess.com`. |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Identity idempotently promoted to this demo's D1-flagged administrator role on every sign-in. |

Do not commit `.env`, Terraform state, the generated `wrangler.jsonc`, or generated binding types (`worker-configuration.d.ts`).

## Local Development

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` generates `wrangler.jsonc` from `wrangler.jsonc.tpl` and the committed local placeholder values in `infra/local-outputs.json`, generates binding types, applies the D1 migration to the local SQLite database (`db:migrate:local`), builds, and starts Vite. No Terraform state or cloud resources are required for the Access, D1, or SPA-shell behavior this phase implements. Open the printed local address and sign in using the local Access dev-login form, which offers `admin@example.com` (this demo's local administrator) and `alice@example.com` (an ordinary identity). An always-visible **Sign out** control uses `/cdn-cgi/access/logout`, useful for recovering from having signed in as the wrong identity. Local D1 data lives under `.wrangler/` and can be deleted between sessions.

The `AI` binding (declared now for Phase 2 onward) has no local simulator; it is not called by any route yet in this phase, so `vite dev` never actually reaches it.

## Testing

```sh
npm run check          # format, lint, type check, Terraform fmt/validate
npm run test:unit      # Worker and client unit projects
npm run test:integration
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
```

## Deployment

```sh
cd demos/agentic-ai-chat
npm run deploy
```

`npm run deploy` runs `deploy:infra` (Terraform `init` then `apply -auto-approve`, reading configuration from `.env`) followed by `deploy:worker`. Before building, the `predeploy:worker` hook regenerates `wrangler.jsonc` from the live Terraform outputs (`generate-wrangler -cf --terraform infra`) and regenerates binding types (`generate-wrangler-types`). `deploy:worker` then applies D1 migrations to the remote database (`db:migrate:remote`), reads the Access application's real Audience tag from the `access_audience` Terraform output into the `VITE_ACCESS_AUDIENCE` build-time define, and runs `vite build && wrangler deploy`.

### Post-Deploy Verification

1. Visit `https://<DEMO_NAME>.<DEMO_DOMAIN>` (default `https://agentic-chat.cfapps.uk`) and authenticate through the configured identity provider.
2. Confirm the header shows your signed-in email and an **Administrator** badge only if you signed in as `ADMIN_EMAIL`.
3. Sign out using the visible **Sign out** control.
4. In the Cloudflare dashboard under **D1** > `<DEMO_NAME>-db` > Console, run `SELECT email, is_admin, created_at FROM users;` and confirm your identity was upserted with the expected `is_admin` value.
5. Under **Workers & Pages** > `<DEMO_NAME>` > **Logs**, confirm requests are being logged.

## Provisioned Resources

- Worker (`<DEMO_NAME>`) serving the Vue shell as static assets and a Hono API.
- D1 database `<DEMO_NAME>-db`, bound as `DB`, holding the `users` and `chats` tables.
- AI Gateway `<DEMO_NAME>` and two dynamic routes (`<DEMO_NAME>-basic`, `<DEMO_NAME>-reasoning`) — provisioned now, not yet called by any route until a later phase.
- Custom domain `<DEMO_NAME>.<DEMO_DOMAIN>`.
- Access application + allow policy requiring authentication for the whole hostname, with `audience` pinned.
- Workers Logs (100% sampling) and traces (10% sampling).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Access denies sign-in | Confirm `CLOUDFLARE_TEAM_DOMAIN` and that an identity provider is enabled in the target Zero Trust organization, then re-run `npm run deploy`. |
| `401` from `/api/me` | Sign in through Access at `https://<DEMO_NAME>.<DEMO_DOMAIN>`; every API route requires a verified Access identity. |
| Domain fails to provision | Remove the conflicting DNS record and confirm the supplied zone ID owns `DEMO_DOMAIN`. |
| `generate:wrangler` fails during deploy | Run `npm run deploy:infra:apply` successfully first; every referenced Terraform output must exist. |
| D1 migration fails during deploy | Confirm Terraform apply completed (the D1 database must exist) before `db:migrate:remote` runs; re-run `npm run deploy`. |
| `vite dev`/`vitest` hang or fail to reach Workers AI | `Workers AI : Edit` is required only because the `AI` binding has no local simulator (it is unused by any route in this phase); confirm the token has that permission. |
| Signed in but no `Administrator` badge | Confirm you signed in with the identity matching this deployment's `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and that D1 migrations have applied. |

## Teardown

```sh
cd demos/agentic-ai-chat
npm run teardown
```

`npm run teardown` runs `terraform destroy -auto-approve`, removing the Worker, D1 database, AI Gateway and its dynamic routes, custom domain, and Access application/policy, then deletes the locally generated `wrangler.jsonc` and `worker-configuration.d.ts`. Confirm no `<DEMO_NAME>` Worker, D1 database, AI Gateway, or Access application remain in the account before discarding local Terraform state.
